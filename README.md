Here I'm using Base64 encoding to save PDF files into a plain text file.

Options you have to choose:

1. Encoder:
This will convert pdf files into txt files in the current working directory and save to ' encoded_data' folder.

2. Decoder:Â 
Here it will decode back PDF files into the 'decoded_data' folder using text files from the current working directory.

Note:
If you want to use clipboard feature, please install clipboard: pip install clipboard
